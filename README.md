# Book-Reference-Database (ER-Studio-Logical-Data-Model)
Logical data model for a book publishing company designed in ER/Studio as part of an enterprise architecture initiative.

## ER/Studio Logical Data Model
This repository presents a logical data model for a Book Publishing Company as part of an enterprise architecture initiative. The purpose of the initiative is to gain better control and understanding of organizational data as a prerequisite for downstream efforts, including advanced analytics, system integration, and data governance.
The Book Reference Database (BRD) serves as the cornerstone artifact of this initiative, providing a consistent, well-structured representation of core publishing data assets.
## Modeling Approach
The BRD was designed as a logical data model, focusing on business entities, attributes, and relationships independent of any specific database technology. This abstraction ensures that the model can support multiple downstream implementations and analytics use cases.
The model captures the essential structure of the book publishing domain, emphasizing clarity, normalization, and extensibility.
## Tooling
The logical data model was developed using ER/Studio Data Architect, an enterprise-grade data modeling tool widely used for database design and enterprise architecture work.
ER/Studio was used to:
Define entities and attributes
Specify primary keys and foreign keys
Model relationships and cardinalities
Maintain a consistent logical schema
Export ER diagrams and SQL schema artifacts
